	desc	"Protecting audit data also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate 
	log data. Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit data.

Applications providing tools to interface with audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the 
user accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order make access decisions regarding the 
deletion of audit tools.

Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view 
and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators."

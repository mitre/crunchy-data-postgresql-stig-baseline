as the database administrator (shown here as "postgres"):

$ sudo su - postgres

read/write/execute, this is a finding.

this is a finding.'

administrators with a need to know are permitted to read/view these files.

Any files (for example: extra configuration files) created in ${PGDATA?} must be owned by the database administrator,

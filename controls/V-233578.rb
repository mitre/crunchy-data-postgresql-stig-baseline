	desc	"Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without establishing 
	where events occurred, it is impossible to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident.

To compile an accurate risk assessment and provide forensic analysis, it is essential for security personnel to 
know where events occurred, such as application components, modules, session identifiers, filenames, host names, 
and functionality. 

Associating information about where the event occurred within the application provides a means of investigating an 
attack; recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured application."

$ sudo su - postgres

To check that logging is enabled, review supplementary content APPENDIX-C for instructions on enabling logging.

First edit the postgresql.conf file as the database administrator (shown here as \"postgres\"):

$ sudo su - postgres
$ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf

Extra parameters can be added to the setting log_line_prefix to log application related information:

# %a = application name
# %u = user name
# %d = database name
# %r = remote host and port
# %p = process ID
# %m = timestamp with milliseconds
# %i = command tag
# %s = session startup
# %e = SQL state

For example:

log_line_prefix = '< %m %a %u %d %r %p %i %e %s>'

Now, as the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:

$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-${PGVER?}"

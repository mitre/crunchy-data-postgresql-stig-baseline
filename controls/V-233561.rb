First, as the database administrator (shown here as \"postgres\"), create the roles \"joe\" and \"bob\" with LOGIN 
by running the following SQL:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ psql -c \"CREATE ROLE joe LOGIN\"
$ psql -c \"CREATE ROLE bob LOGIN\"

Next, set current role to \"bob\" and attempt to alter the role \"joe\":

$ psql -c \"SET ROLE bob; ALTER ROLE joe NOLOGIN;\"

Now, as the database administrator (shown here as \"postgres\"), verify the denials are logged:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ cat ${PGDATA?}/${PGLOG?}/<latest_log>
< 2016-03-17 11:28:10.004 EDT bob 56eacd05.cda postgres: >ERROR: permission denied to alter role

All denials are logged if logging is enabled. To ensure logging is enabled, review supplementary content APPENDIX-C

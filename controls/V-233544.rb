notification of the appropriate personnel, creating an audit record, and rejecting invalid input."

As the database administrator (shown here as \"postgres\"), make a small SQL syntax error in psql by running the 
following:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ psql -c \"CREAT TABLEincorrect_syntax(id INT)\"
ERROR: syntax error at or near \"CREAT\"

Note: The following instructions use the PGVER and PGLOG environment variables. See supplementary content 
APPENDIX-H for instructions on configuring PGVER and APPENDIX-I for PGLOG.

As the database administrator (shown here as \"postgres\"), verify the syntax error was logged (change the log 
file name and part to suit the circumstances):

$ sudo su - postgres
$ cat ~/${PGVER?}/data/${PGLOG?}/<latest log>

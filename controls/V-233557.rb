Next, verify that role, read, write, and ddl auditing are enabled:

APPENDIX-C for instructions on enabling logging.

Using pgaudit PostgreSQL can be configured to audit these requests. See supplementary content APPENDIX-B for 
documentation on installing pgaudit.

With pgaudit installed the following configurations can be made:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf

Add the following parameters (or edit existing parameters):

pgaudit.log='ddl, role, read, write'

Now, as the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:

$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-${PGVER?}"

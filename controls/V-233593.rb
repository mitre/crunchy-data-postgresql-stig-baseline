It is detrimental for applications to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or 
mission objectives. 

Applications must adhere to the principles of least functionality by providing only essential capabilities.

PostgreSQLs may spawn additional external processes to execute procedures that are defined in PostgreSQL but stored 
in external host files (external procedures). The spawned process used to execute the external procedure may operate

	desc	"Non-organizational users include all information system users other than organizational users, which 
	includes organizational employees or individuals the organization deems to have equivalent status of employees 
	(e.g., contractors, guest researchers, individuals from allied nations). 

Non-organizational users must be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses 
explicitly identified and documented by the organization when related to the use of anonymous access, such as 
accessing a web server. 

Accordingly, a risk assessment is used in determining the authentication needs of the organization. 

Scalability, practicality, and security are simultaneously considered in balancing the need to ensure ease of use 
for access to federal information and information systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk to 
	organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation."

To list all roles in the database, as the database administrator (shown here as \"postgres\"), run the following SQL:

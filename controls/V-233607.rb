  desc 'Protecting audit data also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate
	log data.

Depending upon the log format and application, system and application log tools may provide the only means to
manipulate and manage application and system log data. It is, therefore, imperative that access to audit tools be
controlled and protected from unauthorized access.

Applications providing tools to interface with audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the
user accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order make access decisions regarding the
access to audit tools.

Audit tools include, but are not limited to, OS-provided audit tools, vendor-provided audit tools, and open source
audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records.

If an attacker were to gain access to audit tools, he could analyze audit logs for system weaknesses or weaknesses
in the auditing itself. An attacker could also manipulate logs to hide evidence of malicious activity.'

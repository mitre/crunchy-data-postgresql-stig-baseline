  desc "Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and
	investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within PostgreSQL (e.g., process, module). Certain specific
application functionalities may be audited as well. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits
are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is
capable of generating audit records.

#{input('org_name')[:acronym]} has defined the list of events for which PostgreSQL will provide an audit record generation capability as the
following:

(i) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels,
or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);
(ii) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities, or other
system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different
workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the
information system; and
(iii) All account creation, modification, disabling, and termination actions.

Organizations may define additional events requiring continuous or ad hoc auditing."
  desc 'check', %q(Note: The following instructions use the PGLOG environment variables. See supplementary
	content APPENDIX-I for instructions on configuring PGVER.

Check PostgreSQL audit logs to determine whether organization-defined auditable events are being audited by the system.

For example, if the organization defines 'CREATE TABLE' as an auditable event, issuing the following command should
return a result:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ psql -c "CREATE TABLE example (id int)"
$ grep 'AUDIT:.*,CREATE TABLE.*example' ${PGLOG?}/<latest_log>
$ psql -c 'DROP TABLE example;'

If organization-defined auditable events are not being audited, this is a finding.)
  desc 'fix', "Configure PostgreSQL to generate audit records for at least the #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} minimum set of events.

Using 'pgaudit', PostgreSQL can be configured to audit these requests. See supplementary content APPENDIX-B for documentation on installing pgaudit.

To ensure that logging is enabled, review supplementary content APPENDIX-C for instructions on enabling logging."
